  This is an introductory course on complex differential geometry, closely following "Lectures on Differential Geometry" by S. S. Chern, W. H. Chen and K. H. Lam. The course aims to acquaint students with some of the major concepts in complex differential geometry, which can serve as a basis for further study.

## Course Synopsis
We will start with a revision lecture briskly reviewing the most relevant points of real differential geometry. The rest of the series will focus mainly on complex differential geometry, covering certain supporting materials as we go. Starting from complex manifolds we will cover complex structures on vector spaces, almost complex structures and almost complex manifolds, connections on complex manifolds, the Dolbeault cohomology group and Hodge decomposition, Hermitian structures and Hermitian manifolds, the Kähler form and Kähler manifolds (we may or may not touch briefly on symplectic manifolds), and lastly we will end with a short discussion of Calabi-Yau manifolds.

## Course Prerequisites
This course assumes that students are fairly familiar with the following prerequisite material:
- Complex Euclidean Space and Calculus: All of it, with an emphasis on Holomorphic Maps and the Cauchy-Riemann Equations.
- Linear Algebra: Definition of a vector space, Vector Bases, Linear Maps, Change of Bases, Jacobians, Dual Spaces.
- Multivariable Calculus: Partial Derivatives, Chain Rule, Multiple Integral, Smooth Maps.
- Differential Forms: Definition, exterior algebras, exterior derivatives and the wedge product.
- Multilinear Algebra or Tensor Algebra: Definition of a tensor space, index notation and manipulation, Einstein summation convention, Rank, Covariance vs Contravariance.
- Group Theory (Minimal): Definition, Homomorphisms.
- Topology: Definition, Neighbourhoods, Connectedness, Compactness, Continuity, Continuous Maps, Homeomorphisms, Open and Closed Sets.
- Real Differential Geometry (Optional): Topological Manifolds, Charts and Atlases, Differential Manifolds, Tangent and Cotangent Spaces.
As we get further along the list I will explain more and more these concepts as we go, the last two especially, so minimal prior contact is necessary.

## Reading Material
The main reading material for this course is *Lectures on Differential Geometry* by Chern, Chen and Lam. For topology review one may consult *Topology* by James Munkres. Further reading material will be recommended as the course progresses.
