abstract: >
  Dark matter makes up >80% of nonrelativistic matter in our cosmos,
  yet its particle identity (mass, spin etc) is unknown. What can we
  learn about the mass and intrinsic spin of dark matter particles from
  astrophysical observations? I will discuss how spin can determine the
  lightest mass dark matter particles can have. When dark matter is a
  sufficiently light boson, it becomes wavelike — I will show that in
  this case its intrinsic spin angular momentum can impact the (i)
  variation of dark matter density inside halos, (ii) lead to formation
  of solitons with macroscopic intrinsic spin, and (iii) leave clues in
  initial conditions for formation of structure in the early universe.
  Time permitting, I might briefly discuss direct detection prospects
  for such dark matter, and novel connections to "spinor” Bose-Einstein
  Condensates in the laboratory.
