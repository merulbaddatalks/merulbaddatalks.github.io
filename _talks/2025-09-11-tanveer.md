  The application of mathematics is all around us, though in most cases, the mathematics is "under the hood" and not visible to those involved in the applications.

  In this talk I will remark on the nature of mathematics and its "unreasonable" effectiveness in describing the world around us, and how it contrasts other sciences, and how mathematical thinking is an essential skill. The ability to reason from point A to point B in a sequence of logical steps is a skill that carries over to other areas of human endeavor.

  I will also remark on a vision of advancing this skill in Bangladeshâ€”how intervention in key areas can create a multiplier effect that help create a technically savvy manpower for the future Bangladesh economy.
