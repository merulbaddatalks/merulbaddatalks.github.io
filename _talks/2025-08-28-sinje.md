abstract: |
  Trees play a vital role in the climate by producing oxygen, supporting ecosystems, and
  benefiting both communities and the environment. They are essential for maintaining
  ecological balance and overall ecosystem health. However, beetle infestations pose a
  significant threat to forests, causing severe ecological and economic damage, particularly
  when aggressive species, such as spruce and mountain pine beetles, heavily attack trees.
  These infestations can lead to widespread tree mortality and long-term environmental
  consequences. This study highlights the importance of tree plantations and develops a
  mathematical model to analyze tree-beetle interactions, incorporating the effects of
  wildfire and harvesting. We examine equilibrium points, their stability, and the basic
  reproduction number to understand beetle population dynamics. Additionally, we introduce
  an optimal control strategy to mitigate beetle attacks, incorporating a pesticide variable
  into the model to reduce beetle populations. The model is numerically solved to generate
  visual representations, and optimal control strategies are applied to minimize the impact
  of beetle infestations using pesticides. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore
  factors influencing beetle reproduction, particularly their preference for trees with
  larger diameters, thicker bark, and extensive phloem, which enhance brood survival and
  growth. This study underscores the urgency of implementing effective beetle management
  strategies to protect and restore forest tree populations, ensuring long-term ecosystem
  sustainability.
