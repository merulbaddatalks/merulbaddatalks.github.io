  I did my MSc on the correlation between radio and x-ray emission from clusters of galaxies, PhD on the observation of cosmic hydrogen from the epoch of reionization, and postdoc on the direction-dependent sensitivities of the antennas used in array radio telescopes (ART). These are my three lives. After coming back to Bangladesh, I have been struggling to continue these three works mainly because of the lack of time (due to teaching load) and high-performance computers (HPC). Things have improved a little bit recently. Now I am trying to combine these three lives to create an integrated research environment where I can supervise students in all three areas (from those three lives) in a mutually dependent way. We can model the systematic effects of radio telescopes to facilitate the observation of cosmic hydrogen which in turn will improve our understanding of the large-scale structure, its clusters of galaxies, facilitating the mapping of the universe and the testing of theories. In this talk I will try to give an overview of the ARTs behind this struggle.
