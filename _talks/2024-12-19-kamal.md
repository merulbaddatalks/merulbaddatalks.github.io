abstract: >
  In this talk, I will discuss the widely misunderstood and underestimated cosmological constant problem in a pedagogical fashion to beginners. I will examine the shortcomings of traditional approaches, exploring why they sometimes fail. I will also draw parallels between the universeâ€™s current accelerated expansion and the cosmological constant problem. Ultimately, I will argue why a quantum gravity framework is needed and conclude by discussing potential paths toward a resolution.
