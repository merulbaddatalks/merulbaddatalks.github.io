abstract:  
  Semi-simple Lie Algebras admit quantisations through their Universal Enveloping Algebras. In this talk I will introduce the Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and discuss its quantisation. I will touch on the Representation Theory of quantised Lie Algebras and discuss the combinatorics of crystal bases arising from these representations. The talk will be approachable for undergraduate students with basic understanding of Algebra.
