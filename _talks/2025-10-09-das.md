abstract: |

 It shall be evident to any careful reader that, "standard textbook presentation" of Newton's Laws is very unsatisfactory. It is marred with the use of undefined terms, hidden assumptions and circular reasoning, e.g, not providing an operational definition of "Mass", using the concept of "Force" without mathematically defining what it means, defining "Force" circularly using the 2nd law, etc. As such, although these laws form the foundations of Classical Mechanics, critical readers are left with a feeling of "it-is-what-it-is" from standard textbooks. In this pedagogical talk, I shall talk about the inconsistencies in the standard presentation, and then outline a precise and rigorous reformulation of Newton's Laws that solves these problems. The talk should be accessible to anyone with a high-school knowledge of mathematics.
