abstract:  
  In this talk, we start with the Bianchi Type Universes and discuss the Kasner solutions. Then we move onto  a review of Kasner Solution with arbitrary signatures which incorporates a d-dimensional gravity theory with m-form and also with a dynamical scalar field. Finally, we discuss possible embeddings in stringy supergravity.
