  Globular clusters (GCs) are critical for understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Their ages provide constraints on Galactic formation models. This study revisits the age scale of Galactic GCs using photometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope and spectroscopic data from the APOGEE survey. The SPInS (Stellar Parameters Inferred Systematically) framework was employed to infer ages through Bayesian analysis with Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Initial tests on NGC 5053 refined the methodology but highlighted computational inefficiencies in SPInS, particularly for large datasets. Despite these challenges, the analysis produced robust age estimates consistent with the established age of the Milky Way. Anticipated optimizations to SPInS will allow scaling the methodology to all selected clusters, enabling precise age determinations and enhancing our understanding of Galactic formation history.
