abstract: >
  From the ancient Lo Shu square of China to Dürer’s Renaissance engraving, magic squares have captivated minds for centuries. Beyond the well-known magic sum, these grids hide deeper wonders like the magic product and magic pairwise product, revealing unexpected mathematical patterns. This talk takes you from building simple magic squares to exploring their hidden structures through stories, puzzles, and hands-on activities. Something "ELEMENTARY" can still hold endless magic, if you look closely enough.
