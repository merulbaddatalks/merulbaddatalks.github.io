abstract: >
  The first Weyl algebra $$ A_1 $$ arises naturally in quantum mechanics as the algebra generated by position and momentum operators, satisfying the canonical commutation relation $$ [âˆ‚,x]=1 $$. In characteristic zero, this algebra admits no nontrivial finite-dimensional representations. In contrast, over a field of characteristic $$ p>0$$, $$A_1 $$ has a much richer structure: it admits a large center and possesses many finite-dimensional irreducible representations. In this talk, we describe how these representations can be classified by central characters, and how their dimensions are governed by algebraic properties of the center.
