date: 2025-02-27
speaker: "Md. Rafsanjany Jim"
affiliation: "Lecturer of Mathematics, BRAC University"
abstract: >
  This talk explores how supersymmetric quantum mechanics can be formulated in a non-commutative space using the framework of deformation quantization. It delves into foundational aspects of non-commutative geometry, discusses physical motivations, and outlines the implications for quantum theory and symmetry structures in modern physics.
